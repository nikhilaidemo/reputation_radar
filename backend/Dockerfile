# Placeholder for backend Dockerfile
# This file would contain instructions to build a Docker image for your FastAPI application.
# For local development, you can run directly using `uvicorn`.

# Example (untested, for reference):
# FROM python:3.10-slim-buster
# WORKDIR /app
# COPY ./requirements.txt .
# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
# COPY . .
# CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
