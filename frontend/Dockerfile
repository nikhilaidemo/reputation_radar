# Placeholder for frontend Dockerfile
# This file would contain instructions to build a Docker image for your React application.
# For local development, you can run directly using `npm start`.

# Example (untested, for reference):
# FROM node:18-alpine
# WORKDIR /app
# COPY package.json ./
# RUN npm install
# COPY . .
# ENV REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://backend:8000/api/v1 # Adjust for Docker network
# RUN npm run build
# FROM nginx:alpine
# COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
# EXPOSE 80
# CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
